      <description>We are pleased to announce that our proposal to submit our code as an open-source platform extending Eclipse Theia has been accepted by the Eclipse community. Our code will be hosted under the name:
Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE Next step: submit our initial contribution for IP review. You can already read the description of our open-source project here:
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.opensmartclide
For the record, our code was developed in an open and public manner under the umbrella of Eclipse Research Labs, an infrastructure of the Eclipse Foundation dedicated to supporting research projects under development that are not yet ready to be released as an open-source Eclipse project: respecting open-source license compatibilities, business-friendly, contributor agreements, and copyright completeness.</description>
